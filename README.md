# Java client for backand.com serverless service

This is the early stage of the creation of a client to access backand.com api.

At the moment it will only address backand.com service on a database / REST api view.

I've found the documentation lacking so far especially in terms of retrieving objects through relationships, so will mainly be slowly reverse engineering the process and work with that.

No update schedule as this is a side project.

# API Dependencies

 * GLib to provide proxies for backand objects.

 * GSon from google to parse JSon response from backand.com.
